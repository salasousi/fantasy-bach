# Fantasy Bachelor
<h4>The inspiration behind this project derives from the concept of fantasy football in relation to the ABC reality tv series, “The Bachelor (/Bachelorette)”</h4>
<ul>
<li>AAU, you will gather a group of 3-5 friends that will be in your “league” to compete with. After the new season’s first episode premiers, the league members will host a drafting in which they take turns choosing a cast member to be on their own team until none are left. </li>
<li>Each user will utilize the 'Manage' tab on the website to manually enter in their selected cast members.</li>
<li>Prior to each episode, the users will enter in their “starting lineup” consisting of three cast members from their team. These selected “players” will be qualified to gain or lose points based on a point-system I designed displayed on the 'Rules' page of the website for users to reference.</li>
<li>There will be a selected “commissioner” for each league to serve as admin in charge of tracking points and posting the current standings of each user’s team. AAA, there will be an authorized page that allows them editing permission to this form for other users to see.</li>
<li>There is a section of the website that is designed like a blog in which users can post and comment on the episodes each week. This will serve as a “group chat” feature for the users.</li>
</ul>
